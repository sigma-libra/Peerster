Dear students,

As specified in the handouts, when you submit the homework, you *must* fill in the online text field, with:

- either one of the three homework 1 reviews you’re building on:​ "Built on review assignment, ID x", where x is0, 1or 2

- or with "Built on own assignment", if you use your own homework 1.
